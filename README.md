Bruh, just finished The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and I’m just... I mean, what even was that? 😂 Like, they really went all out with the sea creatures this time, didn’t they? Did you see how that siren just jumps at Geralt like she’s a freakin' dolphin or something? Lol, I have no idea how they keep topping the madness from the last 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯, but somehow they do. 

Anyway, I still can’t get over the whole underwater sequence with Yennefer. Can we talk about the CGI? Like, seriously, top-notch stuff. And here I was thinking maybe I shouldn’t bother to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but there’s no way I could’ve missed this, not for that ocean magic. 🤯 Yennefer channeling the elements like it’s just another Tuesday... classic.

I mean, props to him for staying relevant despite everything yo.

Not kidding, those credits rolled, and I just sat there like, do I start the whole thing over again or what? This is what happens when fantasy lands in my mundane Thursday night, haha. What’s that thing people say? Escapism achieved! Let’s just say Sirens of the Deep was worth every second. 👌 Anyway, ping me if you wanna chat more Witcher craziness later!
